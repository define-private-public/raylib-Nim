Bindings for raylib: http://raylib.com

Official repo here: https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/raylib-Nim

Treat other places as mirrors, but issues can still be logged on the GitHub
mirror.

Notes:
- Working on only Linux for now
- Desktop only (no Android or Web, sorry)
- Still a work in progress
- Not everything is bound

- [ ] OS X support
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Make it as "Nim Friendly," as possible
- [ ] Talk with raylib upstream 
- [ ] Unbound things
